## 📈 Segment-Based Churn Analysis

### Contract Type
- **Month-to-month** contracts have a **43%** churn rate  
- Compared to only **11%** for one-year and **3%** for two-year contracts  
👉 *Flexible contracts correlate with high churn risk*

### Payment Method  
- Customers using **electronic checks** churn at **45%**  
- Other methods show significantly lower churn (15–19%)  
👉 *Electronic payments may correlate with lower engagement or higher-risk profiles*

### Internet Service
- **Fiber optic users** churn the most (**42%**), followed by DSL (**19%**)  
- Customers without internet services have very low churn (**7%**)  
👉 *Service type affects retention — potentially due to reliability or pricing*

### Tenure Group  
- New customers churn at **53%** within the first 6 months  
- Churn drops as tenure increases (down to **10%** after 4 years)  
👉 *Customer loyalty grows with time — retention tactics should focus on early lifecycle*

### Monthly Charges
- Higher-paying customers churn more (up to **34%** for $60–89/month)  
- Lowest churn seen in <$30 group (**10%**)  
👉 *Billing frustration or perceived value may influence retention*

### Support Usage
- Customers who **never contacted support** churned at **42%**  
- Those who engaged support churned far less (**15%**)  
👉 *Customer service engagement can be a powerful retention signal*
